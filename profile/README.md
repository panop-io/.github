# Panop

In the dynamic world of cybersecurity, our journey at Panop is deeply rooted in a rich history of protecting the digital frontier. With decades of collective experience in large-scale, internet-facing enterprises, our team has been at the forefront of securing mission-critical websites and e-commerce platforms. We've equipped countless customers with robust WAF and anti-DDoS solutions, supporting the safeguarding of over 700 billion USD in cumulative revenue last year alone.

The inception of Panop was sparked by a recurring challenge we observed among our customers: the struggle to fully grasp their digital exposure. Many organizations found it daunting to ensure each asset was securely configured and to maintain visibility over the constant changes within their expansive digital landscapes. Our deep-seated expertise in both offensive and defensive security strategies led us to a pivotal realization—the transformative power of automation in addressing the complex security needs of large organizations.

Embracing this philosophy, we set out to revolutionize cybersecurity practices. Panop embodies the essence of continuous vigilance, a concept inspired by the panopticon from Orwell's 1984—a metaphor for our commitment to unwavering surveillance and protection in the digital realm. Our platform is designed to automate the meticulous process of identifying, assessing, and securing digital assets, thereby enabling organizations to fortify their defenses against the ever-evolving threats of the cyber world.

At Panop, we are more than just a cybersecurity company; we are a collective of visionaries, dedicated to empowering businesses to navigate the intricate web of digital threats with confidence. Our story is one of innovation, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in cybersecurity, driven by the belief that with the right tools and expertise, the digital world can be a safer place for everyone.
